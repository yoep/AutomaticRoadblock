            <param name="isAvailable">Function returning a bool indicating whether the button is currently available (if false, button is hidden). This is often called, so try making this light-weight (e.g. simply return the value of a boolean property). Make sure to do proper checking in your Action too, as the user can forcefully display all buttons via a setting in their config file.</param>

            <summary>
            This function will be called directly by VocalDispatch.
            It then calls the function you specify in SetupVocalDispatchAPI.
            The function you specify has no knowledge of VocalDispatch and can therefore exist safely in your code.
            This function cannot exist safely in other classes and must be hidden away here, instead, to provide a safe middleman between VocalDispatch and your code.
